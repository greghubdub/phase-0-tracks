# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    Based on the video in Challenge 1.3, version control is important in programming because it helps keep track of the changes that people have made to the code. By having different versions, people can select new code or revert code in their code base. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch allows the programmer to work off a copy of a prior save point. In the example that they showed in the videos (Challenges 1.4 and 1.5), it allowed the programmer to make a copy of the master and make changes. It allows a different programmer to review the changes before committing those changes. I would use this when working on my projects because I would want a copy of my code in the last state it worked. In the worse possible scenario where my new changes broke something, I can always revert it back to a prior state. Branches also help when programming in a team because as changes are made, they can be reviewed and tested before incorporating it into the final product.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	Based on all the videos (Challenges 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5), a commit is a sort of save point for the changes that a programmer has made. It's helpful to explain why the change was made or what was added. A vague message like "made changes" may not help the initial or subsequent programmers understand why the change was made.
* What is a merge conflict?
	According to a GitHub's merge conflict page (https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/), a merge conflict can occur when there are overlapping and overriding changes. I'm new to GitHub so I haven't encountered this just yet, but I can easily imagine a scenario where two programmers make branches off the same master file only to make changes that conflict if they were both committed.
