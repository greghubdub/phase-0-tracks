# PLAN FOR LEARNING JQUERY

## use various types of resources

### resources that look good

#### plus why it looks good to use

* w3schools.com
  * very reference-like information available; plus beginner tutorial
  * maybe start here
* learningjquery.com
  * many many tutorials that come out frequently, target very specific task and skill level
  * could come up with my own ideas and find a tutorial to go with them
* learn.jquery.com
  * supposed to be a 'digestible reference' but I have trouble just looking at this site and finding basics on it
  * might be good as a cross reference later

### How often to stop and test things? I like to do this constantly, but with jquery it might be a bit more of a setup to do so. In any case, I plan on testing out concepts as they come my way throughout my "study up" session

### Overall, I plan to start in the beginner tutorial on w3schools and see if it's too basic. I'll be sure of that fairly quickly. At that point, I will test out what I encountered so far and move to a beginner tutorial on learningjquery.com
