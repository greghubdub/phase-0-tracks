## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

The Linux OS is designed around being easy to access at a low level and customize, free and open to use, and maintaining long term stability of the system (through efficiency, simplicity). A clumsy answer but done in my own words from my own experience!

## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

VPS is a server that exists "in the cloud," in other words, as just a partitioned part of another remote server, but acting as its own machine. This can be a huge advantage in terms of cost and convenience, especially for sites that don't need much power. On the other hand, having a dedicated server can give you maximum power and flexibility in terms of management and software.

## Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Running programs as root in a Linux system is considered bad practice because root privileges allow the user to change any number of things in the program files, path of commands, etc., many of which could break the system irreparably.
