<!-- 
* The purpose of semantic tags seems to be to help humans dealing with the code later on, such as someone doing the layout of a page. In those cases, semantic elements like <article> <header> and <footer> would be quite useful because you know the role of that content, even if it will appear somewhere very different in 2 different pages
* The browser displays elements in a default order, i.e. the order they appear, unless otherwise specified
* Snippets are a very interesting tool because they allow you to call up a familiar series of tags immediately. I imagine I will be taking advantage of this tool
* I was not clear on what semantic elements are up to, when we started this challenge. Now that my understanding is more complete, I will use them to update my personal webpage
